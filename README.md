**LungScapeAI**

Interactive AI-powered 3D visualization of lung anatomy and function from medical imaging

**📌 Overview**

LungScapeAI is an AI-powered web application that transforms 2D lung CT/MRI scans into interactive 3D lung models with anatomical layering and functional insights.

The project bridges the gap between raw medical imaging and human understanding by combining medical image segmentation, geometry-based 3D reconstruction, and a learning-first visualization interface. LungScapeAI is designed for clinicians, patients, and researchers to explore lung anatomy, understand disease impact, and visualize functional metrics spatially.
